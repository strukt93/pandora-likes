# pandora-likes
Pandora-likes is a simple Python script that grabs your likes on pandora.com and saves them to an HTML file. Run the script,
supply your Pandora email/password combination (won't steal them I swear), and the script will do the rest. The script will prompt to download the liked tracks if the user account is subscribed to Pandora Premium. Not all of the tracks are downloadable via this method since Pandora has a policy that denies direct access to the audio URLs of a subset of their tracks.
